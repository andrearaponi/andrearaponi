# About Me

Solution Architect at Engineering. CloudNative enthusiast.

Focused on Kubernetes, architectural design, and energy optimization.

Strong believer that algorithms and data structures matter more than frameworks.
Open source contributor. No technological fanaticism.

Python, C, Rust, Go, Scala, JavaScript, Lua, Java.

When not architecting solutions, I climb mountains, run, and read.
Often on the same day.
